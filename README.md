# Article-Retrieval-System-with-Llama-7b
This project is a Python script designed for information retrieval using a combination of techniques including semantic search and keyword matching. The script also integrates a LLama-2-7b-chat-hf for natural language processing tasks. The retrieval process is guided by a predefined system prompt, so the responses adhere to specified guidelines.
